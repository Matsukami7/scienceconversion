Convert Factorio Science up and down a tier!
Now with: N.A.R.O.S "N.aros A.rtificially R.esearched O.uter S.pace" (Space Science)

Hello and thank you for visitng my git and this Factorio mod

From the factorio devs: "Factorio is a game in which you build and maintain factories.

You will be mining resources, researching technologies, building infrastructure, automating production, and fighting enemies. Use your imagination to design your factory, combine simple elements into ingenious structures, apply management skills to keep it working, and protect it from the creatures who don't really like you.

The game is very stable and optimized for building massive factories. You can create your own maps, write mods in Lua, or play with friends via Multiplayer."


This game is great, and this is my first mod! A great friend taught me how to mod factorio games, and i wanted to share it with you!

After researching the requiremnts in the game, you can turn one science into another, up and down a tier. Allowing you to create new and unique factories!

you can download the mod IN the factorio mod menu by searching "science conversion", or "Narokuu"

Or download the zip here, and put it in your mod folder in your factorio director!

If you have any suggestions, bugs, requests, or anything else, plase feel free to comment OR submit a request!
